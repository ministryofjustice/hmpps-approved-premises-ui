  <p>People in prison or people on probation who are managed at the following Tiers would be eligible to apply for an Approved Premises (AP) placement.</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>A3</li>
    <li>A2</li>
    <li>A1</li>
    <li>B3</li>
    <li>B2</li>
    <li>B1</li>
    <li>C3 (women only)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Applications for an AP placement can still be made in exceptional circumstances.</p>

  {% set detailsHTML %}
  <p>An AP placement may occasionally be required to manage the risk posed by, or to, people managed in Tiers C3, C2, C1, or people in specific circumstances.</p>

  <p>This may include (but is not limited to):</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>People in the community who have been convicted of sex offences and have been publicly identified, for example through social media (Tier C)</li>
    <li>Life / IPP or other prisoners who have served long periods (over 10 years) in custody</li>
    <li>People with a high national media profile (Tier C) </li>
    <li>People managed at MAPPA Level 2 or 3 (Tier C) </li>
    <li>People who are managed on Post Sentence Supervision or Community Orders without a multi-agency contingency plan in place </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Where this is being considered, there should be a discussion between the Head/Deputy Head of Probation Delivery Unit (PDU) or Community Head of Public Protection (HoPP) and an AP Area Manager / CRU Manager or Head of Public Protection (Residential).</p>
  <p>In these exceptional cases an application to an AP can be made, but a placement is not guaranteed.</p>
